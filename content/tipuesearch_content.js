He wrote a format of TEX called Plain TEX, but many people find Plain TEX complicated, so \xa0 Leslie Lamport \xa0 wrote a format of TEX called LATEX to make it a bit easier to use. You can think of LATEX as a go-between converting your instructions into TEX. \n 新手入門 LaTeX: \n https://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/novices/novices-screen.pdf \n 在協同產品設計流程中, 各種資料的整理若採分散式版次管理模式(cd2023 將介紹 git 與 \xa0 Fossil SCM \xa0 等兩種工具), 將可有效掌握各組員在設計過程中參與專案的角色與所貢獻的內容. 而此一協同設計架構也能用於編寫簡報或專案報告. 在此將採用 LaTeX 編寫設計過程中的各種技術文件及導引. \n 以 cmsimde 建立 .tex 協同設計文字檔案: \n 在 cmsimde 網際內容管理系統中, Python 可以利用 bs4 將 content 目錄中的 \xa0 html 轉為 text , 之後若要放入 .tex 運用, 則必須再進行檔案編修. \n 另外, 則可直接透過 cmsimde 的 editor 寫出所需要的 latex/file.tex, 也就是直接利用網際編輯器處理 .tex 檔案內容, 並且配合 images 中的圖檔, 以 Github Actions 轉為 .pdf \n 協同分組報告設定檔案: \xa0 https://mdecd2023.github.io/resume-scrum-1/downloads/latex_cd_report_using_github_actions.7z\xa0 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '分組報告.html'}]};
